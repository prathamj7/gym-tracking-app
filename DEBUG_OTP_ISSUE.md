# üîç Debug OTP "Incorrect Code" Issue

## ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Google sign-in works perfectly ‚úÖ
- JWT template is configured correctly ‚úÖ
- Convex integration is working ‚úÖ

## ‚ùå The Problem:
OTP codes always show "Incorrect code" even when entered correctly.

## üîß Debugging Steps:

### Step 1: Check Your Email
1. **Check your Gmail inbox** for `pratjoshi7@gmail.com`
2. **Look for email from Clerk** (might be in Spam/Promotions)
3. **Email subject**: Usually "Your sign-in code for [App Name]"
4. **Make sure you're using the LATEST code** (not an old one)

### Step 2: Verify Email in Clerk Dashboard
1. Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Go to **"Configure"** ‚Üí **"Email & SMS"**
3. Check if **"Email verification code"** is properly configured
4. Look for any warnings or issues with email delivery

### Step 3: Check Development Mode Limitations
Clerk in development mode has some limitations:
- Email delivery might be slower
- Some email providers might block development emails
- Rate limiting might be stricter

### Step 4: Try These Solutions:

#### Solution A: Wait Longer
- Wait **2-3 minutes** after requesting OTP
- Check **all email folders** (Inbox, Spam, Promotions, Updates)

#### Solution B: Use Test Email
- Go to Clerk dashboard ‚Üí **"Configure"** ‚Üí **"Email & SMS"** 
- Look for **"Test mode"** or **"Development emails"**
- Some development setups show test codes in the dashboard

#### Solution C: Check Browser Console
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for any errors when submitting OTP
4. Check **Network** tab for failed requests

### Step 5: Alternative Test
Try this flow to isolate the issue:
1. **Use Google sign-in first** (we know this works)
2. Then **sign out**
3. Try **email OTP** with the same email address

## ü§î Common Causes:

1. **Email not delivered**: Check spam folder
2. **Old code**: Using expired OTP (they expire quickly)
3. **Wrong email**: Make sure you're checking the right email account  
4. **Development limitations**: Clerk dev mode email delays
5. **Rate limiting**: Too many attempts in short time

## üí° Quick Test:
Try entering **any random 6-digit code** - if you get the same "Incorrect code" error immediately, the issue might be with the OTP validation logic rather than the actual code.
