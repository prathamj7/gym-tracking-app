# 🚨 URGENT: Fix "Use phone" Issue in Clerk Dashboard

## The Problem:
Your Clerk form is showing "Use phone" option because your Clerk application still has phone authentication enabled in the dashboard.

## 🔧 Fix Steps (Do this NOW):

### Step 1: Go to Clerk Dashboard
1. Open https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Select your **"gym-tracking-app"** (or whatever you named it)

### Step 2: Disable Phone Authentication
1. Go to **"User & Authentication"** → **"Email, Phone, Username"**
2. Set these **EXACT** settings:
   - **Email address**: ✅ **Required**
   - **Phone number**: ❌ **Don't require** 
   - **Username**: ❌ **Don't require**

### Step 3: Configure Authentication Methods
1. Go to **"User & Authentication"** → **"Authentication strategies"**
2. **ENABLE** only these:
   - ✅ **Email verification code** (this is your OTP)
   - ✅ **Google**
3. **DISABLE** everything else:
   - ❌ **Password**
   - ❌ **Phone verification code** ← This is causing "Use phone" to show
   - ❌ **All other social providers** (Facebook, Apple, etc.)

### Step 4: Save and Test
1. Click **"Save"** in Clerk dashboard
2. Clear your browser cache/cookies
3. Go to `localhost:5173/auth`
4. You should now see **ONLY**:
   - "Continue with Google" button
   - Email input field
   - NO "Use phone" option

## 🎯 Expected Result:
- **Google button** at the top ✅
- **Email input** below it ✅  
- **NO "Use phone" link** ❌
- **NO phone number input** ❌

## If Still Not Working:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Clerk changes to propagate
2. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Clear all site data for localhost:5173

The issue is **100% in your Clerk dashboard configuration** - once you disable phone authentication there, the "Use phone" option will disappear! 🔧
